<h1 id="summary-heading">Born A Crime Chapter 1 & 2 Summary</h1>

<p>The book Born A Crime by Trevor Noah talks about the long history of conflict between <br>
    Zulu and Xhosa tribes, where the Zulu were warrior people who battled against European <br>
    invaders. The Xhosa people tried to learn from the Europeans using strategies instead of<br>
     violence to resist invasion.</p>

     <p>Trevor Noah was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother as a result of<br>
         what was considered a criminal act back then.  The Xhosa women were mostly known for<br>
          being prostitutes and for Patricia, it was a scandalous case because during apartheid the<br>
           relationship between white and black was punishable for five years in jail. Trevor’s <br>
            experience growing up in Johannesburg, South Africa with his rebellious, fearless and
            <br> religious mother who threw her own son from a moving car and jumped with Trevor's <br>
            little brother who was 2 years old, saving their lives from a Zulu man whom they had<br>
             been quarreling with in a minibus. 
    </p>

    <p>Trevor’s mother, Patricia Nombuyiselo, was a fiercely religious woman who took her<br>
         mischievous son to three churches every sunday(the Black one, white one and mixed), a<br>
          prayer meeting on Tuesday, Bible study on Wednesday and youth church on Thursday,<br>
           even when black South Africans were cowering in their homes. </p>

           <p>The story about apartheid times in South Africa and how they resisted is similar to the<br>
             way the Rwandan kingdom resisted Germany colonials, using strategies instead of <br>
             violence. I can’t wait to read the next chapter.</p>
